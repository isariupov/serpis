    <h1>How To Measure And Know The pH Of Soil Or Soil At Home And How To Raise Or Lower The Levels</h1>
<!--<h3>Dropdown Menu inside a Navigation Bar</h3>-->
    
    
<p>It is time to talk about how to measure the pH of the soil or the soil of our garden at home. Something vital for all of us who are dedicated to grow our own food. Whether in a vegetable garden or in an urban garden, it is important to know and know that the most important thing we should always look at is the soil. </p>
 <p>It is what we should take care of, feed and observe the most, because with a healthy, loose, well fertilized soil, rich in nutrients and minerals, our crops will be a success. A part of this soil is precisely the pH. So let's first see what this is and how to measure the pH of the soil in a homemade way and the importance it has in our vegetable garden.</p>
    <h3>What is soil pH</h3>
<p>Before we delve into how to measure soil pH, let's take a look at what all the talk is about. Since it is not always known for sure what we are referring to.

The pH is a value used to measure the alkalinity or acidity of the soil where 7 would be a neutral soil, 7 to 14 would be alkaline and 7 to 0 would be acidic. In general vegetables grow well in a neutral or slightly acidic pH, but soils that are excessively acidic or alkaline can block the nutrients our plants need to absorb and thus fail to develop properly.</p>
    <h3>How to measure soil pH at home</h3>
<p>The materials we are going to need to know the pH of the soil are very simple and surely almost all of them we have at home. Among them we need elements that react to each type of soil to know what type we are talking about and its levels:

Distilled water: we could use tap or rain water, but better distilled water that has a neutral pH, since tap water is slightly alkaline and rain water slightly acidic. Otherwise we can use mineral water.
Vinegar: It will serve us as acid reagent, that is to say if the sample bubbles when adding the vinegar we will know that it is alkaline.
Sodium Bicarbonate: It will serve us as an alkaline reagent, that is to say, if our sample bubbles when adding the bicarbonate we will know that it is an acid soil.</p>

<h3>How to measure soil pH at home</h3>

<p>The first thing to do to know the pH of the soil is to take soil samples. So with a shovel, we will take about 10 or 15 cm of soil from our beds or the orchard. Ideally, we should take it from several points of the bed every 40 or 50 cm of distance in a broadcast or zigzag pattern. We will do this to have a more accurate sample of the soil as a whole and not just from a specific area.

Once we have several samples, we are ready to perform the test. It is always important to take at least two samples from each bed to be able to do both tests.
Measuring soil pH step by step

In a jar or glass we cover the soil sample with distilled water and stir the whole mixture well, once everything is well mixed we can add one of the two elements or vinegar or baking soda. 

If we add the vinegar and no bubbles come out we will know that at least our soil is not alkaline. But in that case, we would still need to determine if it is acidic or neutral. That is why it is important to take at least two samples, since the first one would be discarded. If bubbles appear, we would know that it is alkaline and depending on the amount of bubbles and the continuity in removing them will determine if it is very alkaline or not.

In this case now we will add to the second sample the distilled water and stir again, in this case adding the bicarbonate to see if it reacts. If it does not react or just bubbles come out, we will determine that our soil is neutral or almost neutral. If on the contrary it bubbles, we will know that our soil is acid. And depending on the amount of bubbles and the continuity we will know if it is very acidic or slightly acidic.</p>
